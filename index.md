### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it created a Mad Lib, which is a personal game I’ve played with friends. It was so fascinating to be able to create code for a small game I’ve played in real life. It was one of the first labs so it solidified and gave me a better understanding of how using std::string works. 
* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I found the Julian day system to be very fascinating. Being able to implement an interesting and complex equation, like the Julian Day system, and write code that produced what could be thought of as a simple answer was really intriguing. 
* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it calculated the average of different numbers, which I think is an extremely useful program. Calculating averages can help lead to take data and be applied in real life scenarios. It allowed me to write code that could possibly be implemented in something bigger.
